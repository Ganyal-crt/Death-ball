-- This is a conceptual example and may not directly function in a live environment without further context and adaptation.

-- Define a function to handle the auto-parry logic
local function autoParry()
    -- Check if the ball is approaching and within a certain range
    -- This would involve interacting with game objects and their properties (e.g., ball position, player position)
    -- Example (highly simplified and conceptual):
    local ball = game.Workspace:FindFirstChild("DeathBall") -- Assuming a ball object named "DeathBall"
    local player = game.Players.LocalPlayer.Character -- Current player's character

    if ball and player then
        local ballPosition = ball.Position
        local playerPosition = player.HumanoidRootPart.Position

        -- Calculate distance and direction
        local distance = (ballPosition - playerPosition).Magnitude

        -- If the ball is close enough and moving towards the player
        if distance < 20 and ball.Velocity.Magnitude > 0 then
            -- Simulate a parry action
            -- This would typically involve calling a game function or setting a specific property
            -- Example: game.ReplicatedStorage.Remotes.ParryEvent:FireServer()
            print("Auto-parrying!")
        end
    end
end

-- Set up a loop or event listener to repeatedly call the autoParry function
-- This could be a game event listener or a simple while loop with a delay
-- Example using a game event (e.g., RunService.Stepped for constant updates)
game:GetService("RunService").Stepped:Connect(autoParry)

print("Death Ball Auto-Parry Script Loaded!")
